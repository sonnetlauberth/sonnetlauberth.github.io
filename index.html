        <h3> Benefits: Why go sugar-free?</h3>
        <p>
          Our taste buds are naturally inclined to enjoy sweet foods, but the abundance of sugar in many American diets is wreaking havoc on our health. Removing sugar from your diet can help to reduce food cravings, moodiness, low energy/fatigue, blood sugar crashes, and weight gain. Although it can be tough to reduce the amount of sugar in your diet or remove it completely, after a few weeks you’ll notice a huge difference in your body, mood, and energy levels!

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> One of the easiest ways to begin reducing the amount of sugar in your diet is by replacing processed foods with whole foods. Processed foods are often loaded with sugar and refined carbohydrates so try to reduce process foods and incorporate more fresh, whole foods into your diet. If you’re new to cooking from scratch, start by making 1 - 2 meals from scratch each week and then slowly increasing from there. The key to make changes in baby steps so you feel motivated to keep going and don’t get overwhelmed.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li> Another easy way to reduce the amount of sugar in your overall diet is to cut back on desserts and treat foods. Instead, try to incorporate more naturally-sweet vegetables into your diet. By adding in more foods like winter squash or root vegetables like carrots, you’ll be able to satisfy a sweet tooth, but will also be adding more vitamins and minerals to your diet overall so you feel satisfied.</li>
